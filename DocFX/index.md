# LDtk To Unity

Welcome to the **LDtk to Unity** documentation!  
LDtkToUnity is a feature-rich Unity importer that allows importing projects from Level Design Toolkit (LDtk) into Unity.

### [Install](documentation/Installation/topic_Install.md)

### [Quick Start](documentation/Importer/topic_ProjectImporter.md)

Check the [DOCS](documentation/Importer/topic_ProjectImporter.md) 
or [API](api/LDtkUnity.yml) to find more content.



### Tips
- Most (if not all) fields have tooltips to help explain itself.


- Feedback is always appreciated. Post issues if you find any bugs or want to suggest features or improvements.


- Feel free to help improve this wiki by submitting pull requests.
- To contribute to the repository, you can download the repo and load it into Unity. The samples initially aren't accessible from Unity because of a missing symbolic link. You can fix this by running the .bat file that's in the Assets folder to create a symbolic link.


- Most (if not all) MonoBehaviours and ScriptableObjects have help references available to quickly refer back to topics in this documentation.
