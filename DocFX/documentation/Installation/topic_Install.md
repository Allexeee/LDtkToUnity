# Install

- [Install the OpenUPM-CLI](https://openupm.com/docs/getting-started.html#installing-openupm-cli) if not installed before.
- [Install the LDtkUnity Package](https://openupm.com/docs/getting-started.html#installing-a-upm-package) by entering this into the command line while the directory is scoped on the root of the Unity project:  
```
openupm add com.cammin.ldtkunity
```  
**Note:**
- *Minimum* Unity version 2019.2.
- This package uses [*Newtonsoft.Json for Unity*](https://github.com/jilleJr/Newtonsoft.Json-for-Unity) as the tool to deserialize an LDtk json project.   
  It is automatically installed alongside; no worries.
