- [Install the OpenUPM-CLI](https://openupm.com/docs/getting-started.html#installing-openupm-cli) if not installed before.
- [Install the LDtkUnity Package](https://openupm.com/docs/getting-started.html#installing-a-upm-package) by entering this into the command line while the directory is scoped on the root of the Unity project:  
```
openupm add com.cammin.ldtkunity
```  
Note: *Newtonsoft.Json for Unity* is also installed with this single command; no worries.
