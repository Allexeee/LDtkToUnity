## NOTE: Some of the documentation articles are outdated (particularly Project's sub-assets). Will come back around to this soon as a website instead of a wiki.

The documentation will guide you with the use of this tool to build LDtk levels just as they are in the LDtk editor.  
This guide assumes you have an understanding of C# concepts like Events, Attributes, and Interfaces.  

This tool attempts to be as flexible as possible, but feedback is always appreciated.  
Post issues if you find any bugs or want to suggest features or ideas that offer more flexibility for programming.  

This tool is used for simple LDtk project deserialization for the entire project and all of it's lower data structures.  
However, it also provides a level building approach to build up 2D levels with the goal to mimic exactly what is created in the LDtk editor.

For pixel 2D games, Using the Pixel Perfect Camera is strongly advised; available as a package from the Unity Package Manager.

If you get lost, all MonoBehaviours and ScriptableObjects in this package have help references available to quickly refer back to topics in this guide.
