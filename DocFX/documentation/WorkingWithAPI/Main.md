The API will guide you through working with all of the functionality that the tool allows, and also the API of the LDtk data extensions that are tailored for Unity.

All of the data of an [LDtk Project Json](https://ldtk.io/json/) is deserialized from `JSON` format into many data classes. 
In addition to the data fields, there are some extra utility properties and methods to provide more contextual Unity functionality.

The fields in the data and definitions are based on the LDtk Json Schema converted to C#.

There is a component called `LDtk Entity Renderer` which implements 3 of the interfaces for easy use. check the examples to get an idea.
