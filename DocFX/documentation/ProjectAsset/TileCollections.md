# Tile Collections Section
Tile Collections store tilemap tiles based on a texture's sliced sprites.  
![Section](../../images/unity/inspector/TileCollections.png)

Assigning these Tile Collections are necessary to build the Tile/AutoLayer Layers.

Generate the collections in the [Tilesets Section](Tilesets.md) and then assign them here. 

If a texture was only used for entity visuals in the LDtk editor, then it's not required to assign the field.
