# Backgrounds Section
![Section](../../images/unity/inspector/LevelBackgrounds.png)

If a level has a background defined, then it will show up here. This section does not appear if no backgrounds are defined in LDtk.

When a level is built, this background will accompany the level in it's expected position, as a sprite renderer with proper layer order configuration.

Press the Auto-Assign button to automatically locate all respective textures and fill in their fields.
