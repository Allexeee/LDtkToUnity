# 1.2.0
- Brand new concept of how the assets are stored; all of the assets are condensed to a single asset that stores the json project, which automatically displays the proper fields for int grid values, entities, and tilemaps based off the definitions in the LDtk project
- Automatic enum script generation based off of the enum definitions in the LDtk project
- Added a new "simple project" in the sample
- Bunch of bug fixes

**Note:** The concept of asset collections has been removed in favor of the reworked projects asset. Revise your LDtk asset references in response to this change.
