# LDtkUnity
A package for easy Unity-integration with the Level Designer Toolkit, created by DeepKnight: https://github.com/deepnight/ldtk

It's still in super early stages and highly buggy, but I hope to share this with anyone else who can find this useful.

Available for download from the Unity Package Manager soon.
Also a usage manual will be available soon.
