## Features  
- IntGridValues into Unity's Tilemap component for collision
- Tileset sprites into Unity Tilemap component for the level art; referencing the same image that the LDtk project references; no manual slicing work needed!  
- Entities instantiated from prefabs, including the ability to inject into fields of scripts (All of LDtk's field types supported)
- Many properties and functions that extend onto LDtk's data to be more contextual to Unity
- Supports Unity's [Configurable Enter Play Mode](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ConfigurableEnterPlayMode.html)
