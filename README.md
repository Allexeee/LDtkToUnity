###### Premise & Review
This project started as an attempt to find a level creation solution without worrying about a repetitive workflow in Unity. 
When searching for a solution to mass-produce levels, I discovered LDtk, as it looks/feels amazing and is still relatively new. 
I started working on a personal level importer, but after noticing how convenient and standalone this project has become, I took it upon myself and decided to make it a public repo as a unity package! 
Enjoying it's production, and learning in the process.
