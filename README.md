# LDtk for Unity
A package for easy Unity-integration with the [Level Designer Toolkit, created by deepnight](https://github.com/deepnight/ldtk).  
It's still in very early stages and prone to bugs, but I hope to share this with anyone else who can find this useful.  
Available for download through the Unity Package Manager.
