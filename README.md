# LDtk for Unity
A package for easy Unity-integration with the [Level Designer Toolkit, created by DeepKnight](https://github.com/deepnight/ldtk).

It's still in super early stages, prone to bugs, and relatively broken, but I hope to share this with anyone else who can find this useful.

Available for download through the Unity Package Manager.
