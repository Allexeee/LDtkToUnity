## Features

- Tileset sprites into Unity Tilemap component for the level art; referencing the same image that the LDtk project references; no manual slicing work needed!  
- Entities instantiated from prefabs, including the ability to inject into fields of scripts (All of LDtk's field types supported)
- Many properties and functions that extend onto LDtk's data to be more contextual to Unity
- Supports Unity's [Configurable Enter Play Mode](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ConfigurableEnterPlayMode.html)

###### Premise & Review
This project started as an attempt to find a level creation solution without worrying about a repetitive workflow in Unity. When searching for a solution to mass-produce levels, I discovered LDtk, as it looks/feels amazing and is still relatively new. After noticing how convenient and standalone this project has became as a way to quickly build levels in Unity, I took it upon myself and decided to make it a public repo as a unity package! Enjoying it's production greatly, and learning a lot in the process.
