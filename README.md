###### Premise & Review
This importer started as an attempt to produce levels in an easy and streamlined fashion.
When searching for a solution to mass-produce levels, I discovered LDtk, as its really fun to use and is relatively young. 
I started working on a personal level importer, but after noticing how convenient and standalone the importer has become, I took it upon myself to make this a public repo as a package!
I enjoyed it's production, and learnt a lot in the process.
